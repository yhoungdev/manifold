# If they donâ€™t build ðŸ¦€ Rust SDKs, we will.

**Manifold** is a Rust crate that provides unified SDKs for platforms that lack official Rust support.

> After noticing a gap in Rust SDKs for many popular services, I decided to take the initiative and build them, maybe you've been waiting for this too.
