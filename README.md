# If they don't build ðŸ¦€ Rust SDKs, we'll it.

>> Manifold is a crate that contains all-in-one Rust SDKs for projects that have no Rust SDK support
>I noticed many platforms have no Rust SDK support, so i took matters into my hands ( Maybe).


``` The current platforms are: ```

* Plunk https://www.useplunk.com/
* Twilio https://console.twilio.com/
* Sendgrid https://sendgrid.com/en-us
* KudiSMS https://kudisms.net/
* Flutterwave and Paystack ( Maybe ).



*Also you are free to raise issues on platforms you feel i/we can add*
